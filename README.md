# Auckland Road System v1.0

## My program could do:

1) Ask user to select file, and then open it.

2) Draw Auckland map

3) Keyboard function to implement zoomIn, zoomOut, panLeft, panRight, panUp, panDown and reset function to map.

4) Mouse could also do zoomIn, zoomOut function to map.

5) Search the road name with prefix up to ten possible results.

6) Using trie structure.
